# Starship_project description

The data in this database has been pulled from https://swapi.dev/.

As well as 'people', the API has data on starships. In Python, pull data on all available starships from the API. The "pilots" key contains URLs pointing to the characters who pilot the starship. Use these to replace 'pilots' with a list of ObjectIDs from our characters collection, then insert the starships into their own collection.

You should be able to run your application from a main.py module that only contains code to call methods in other parts of the project.
